\title{Jaccard’s similarity}
\usage{
Jaccard(object, Clustering = "K-means", K, plot = TRUE, R = 100)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{\code{DISCBIO} class object.}

\item{Clustering}{Clustering has to be one of the following:
["K-means","MB"]. Default is "K-means"}

\item{K}{A numeric value of the number of clusters}

\item{plot}{if `TRUE`, plots the mean Jaccard similarities}

\item{R}{number of bootstrap replicates}
}
\value{
A plot of the mean Jaccard similarity coefficient per cluster.
}
\description{
Robustness of the clusters can be assessed by Jaccard’s
  similarity, which reflects the reproducibility of individual clusters
  across bootstrapping runs. Jaccard’s similarity is the intersect of two
  clusters divided by the union.
