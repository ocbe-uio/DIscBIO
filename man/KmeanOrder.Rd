\arguments{
\item{object}{\code{DISCBIO} class object.}

\item{quiet}{if `TRUE`, suppresses intermediary output}

\item{export}{if `TRUE`, exports order table to csv}

The DISCBIO-class object input with the kordering slot filled.

\description{
This function takes the exact output of exprmclust function and
  construct Pseudo-time ordering by mapping all cells onto the path that
  connects cluster centers.
}
\note{
This function has been replaced by pseudoTimeOrdering(), but it is
  being kept for legacy purposes. It will, however, be removed from future
  versions of DIscBIO.
